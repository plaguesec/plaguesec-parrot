# unix-privesc-check
Shell script that runs on UNIX systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, various Linux distributions, FreeBSD 6.2). It detects misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged user to escalate to other users (e.g. root) or to access local apps (e.g. databases). This is a collaborative rework of version 1.0, originally developed by @pentestmonkey
